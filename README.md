## Specific Topics

In this section, we'll begin our journey into automated testing by creating a default Nest application and using Jest (the recommended option) to start writing automated tests.

Specifically, we'll cover:

- **Assertions - Expect**
- **Test Groupers - Describe**
- **Tests - it**
- **Unit Tests**
- **Comparative methods** such as:
  - `toBe`
  - `toEqual`
  - `toBeUndefined`
  - `not`
- **Decorators validations**
- **Class-transformer validations**
- **Plain objects to DTO instances**
- **DTO tests**
- And more

## Required config for e2e testing

To ensure a clear distinction and accurate reporting, you **must separate the coverage reports** for your unit tests and end-to-end (e2e) tests. This is crucial because unit tests cover isolated logic, while e2e tests validate full application flows and integrations. Mixing their coverage can give a misleading view of your application's tested surface.

To achieve this separation, you'll need a dedicated Jest configuration file for your e2e tests, typically named `jest-e2e.json`. Your `package.json` scripts should then point to this specific configuration:

```json
// build after pass all unit tests ant e2e tests
  "build": "npm run test && npm run test:e2e && nest build",
// ...other scripts
  "test:e2e": "jest --config ./jest-e2e.json",
  "test:e2e:watch": "jest --config ./jest-e2e.json --watch",
  "test:e2e:cov": "jest --config ./jest-e2e.json --coverage"
// ...rest of scripts
```

After config, we recommend move the e2e testing files to `./test/e2e`.

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/mau
mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.
